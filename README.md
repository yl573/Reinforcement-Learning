# Playing CartPole With Reinforcement Learning

This is a learning project for me to understand the basics of Q-learning with a neural network.
The code is an adaptation of [the work of n1try](https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_EIcM1ZBnQW2LBaFN6FY65g/).

The learning is done using Keras and the simulations use OpenAI Gym.
